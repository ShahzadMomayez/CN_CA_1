### what is WebRTC?
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a powerful, open-source project that enables real-time communication directly within web browsers and mobile applications. Its magic lies in facilitating peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing without the need for plugins or external software.

Imagine you're using a web app for a video call or multiplayer game, and WebRTC seamlessly handles the live communication between your device and your friend's. It's used in video conferencing apps, live streaming platforms, collaborative work tools, and even gaming applications.

The WebRTC API includes media capture, encoding and decoding audio and video, transportation layer, and session management.
